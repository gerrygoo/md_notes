Hey! so this is the start of this (actually yesterday) year's study challenge that I'll be doing until I leave home to do a SWE internship. Actually, my goal of the challenge is to study some things that I hope will be of use to me in my time away.

Mainly C++ and how to write better code in general. My study materials will be:

* The C++ programming language by Bjarne Stroustrup
* Clean Code by Robert C. Martin

I actually did start the challenge yesterday but I posted my study notes to my personal 'tumblr blog' by mistake. I'll leave a screenshot here for record's sake. I'll be deleting the notes from the other (they don't belong there) blog and transcribing them here into md for clarity.
